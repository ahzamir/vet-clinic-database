# Vet Clinic Database

> In this project, I have used a relational database to create the data structure for a vet clinic. I have started with one table, and step by step, I created a complete database with data about: animals, animals' owners, clinic employees, and, visits.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**
